# Abscess Management Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the standard clinical protocol for management of skin abscesses in our clinic.

## Initial Assessment
- Evaluate size, location, depth, and signs of systemic infection.
- Consider imaging if deep or atypical presentation.
- Obtain cultures if recurrent, immunocompromised, or suspected MRSA.

## Incision and Drainage (I&D)
- Use local anesthesia (lidocaine with epinephrine as appropriate).
- Make a linear incision over the point of maximum fluctuance.
- Break loculations with a hemostat or curette.
- Irrigate with sterile saline.

## Post-Procedure Care
- Packing: Use iodoform gauze or plain gauze for deeper abscesses.
- Dressing: Apply absorbent dressing (e.g., ABD pad) and secure with tape or netting.
- Antibiotics: Prescribe based on culture results or empiric coverage for CA-MRSA (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline).

## Follow-up
- Re-evaluate in 48–72 hours for packing removal and wound check.
- Instruct patient on signs of worsening infection (fever, increased pain, erythema spreading).
- Schedule follow-up as needed.

## Special Considerations
- Facial abscesses: consult with ENT or plastics.
- Perianal abscesses: consider surgical referral.
- Recurrent abscesses: evaluate for hidradenitis suppurativa or immunodeficiency.
